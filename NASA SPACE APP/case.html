                <ul class="post-text">
                    <li><strong>India ranks 7th</strong> in the Global Climate Risk Index (2021).</li>
                    <li><strong>Women in rural India</strong> form 75% of the agricultural workforce but own only 13.9% of farmland.</li>
                    <li><strong>Climate change deepens gender inequality</strong>, impacting women due to limited access to resources, economic opportunities, and decision-making.</li>
                    <li><strong>Global Relevance:</strong> India’s climate vulnerability, combined with large population dependence on agriculture, makes gender and climate challenges globally critical.</li>

                <h2 class="post-title">Problem Statement</h2>
                <ul class="post-text">
                    <li><strong>Agricultural Vulnerability:</strong> Women make up 48% of the agricultural labor force but face unequal access to land, credit, and technology.</li>
                    <li><strong>Resource Scarcity:</strong> Climate change worsens water scarcity; rural women walk up to 6 km daily to fetch water, reducing time for education and economic activities.</li>
                    <li><strong>Displacement and Disaster Impact:</strong> In 2020, 13.6 million people in India were displaced by climate disasters, with women more vulnerable to livelihood loss, gender-based violence, and health issues.</li>
                    <li><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Climate change hinders women’s empowerment, worsens gender inequality, and slows India’s socio-economic development.</li>

                <ul class="post-text">
                    <li><strong>Climate Events in India:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Floods:</strong> States like Assam, Bihar, and Uttar Pradesh face annual floods. In 2021, Assam floods displaced 5 million people.</li>
                            <li><strong>Droughts:</strong> Maharashtra and Rajasthan experienced severe droughts affecting 1.6 million women farmers in Maharashtra (2018-2019).</li>
                            <li><strong>Cyclones:</strong> Coastal areas in Odisha and West Bengal are hit by cyclones. Cyclone Fani (2019) displaced 1.2 million people, disproportionately affecting women.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Key Players:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Women Farmers: Contribute over 60% of the rural workforce but own only 13.9% of the land.</li>
                            <li>Local Governments and NGOs: SEWA and other organizations help women with climate adaptation skills.</li>
                            <li>Government: The National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) addresses gender issues but lacks implementation.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Actions Taken:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Government Initiatives:</strong> The National Adaptation Fund for Climate Change supports resilience projects, but only 10-12% have gender-specific interventions.</li>
                            <li><strong>Local Adaptation Programs:</strong> NGOs work on water conservation, clean energy access, and climate-resilient agriculture for women in rural areas.</li>

                            <li><strong>Patriarchal Norms:</strong> Women bear the brunt of increased workloads during climate-induced resource scarcity due to traditional gender roles.</li>
                            <li><strong>Limited Land Ownership:</strong> Women’s land ownership is low at 13.9%, reducing access to credit, subsidies, and decision-making.</li>
                            <li><strong>Low Access to Financial Resources:</strong> Women’s limited access to formal financial services hinders their ability to adopt climate adaptation strategies.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Vulnerability Theory:</strong>

                            <li><strong>Economic Vulnerability:</strong> Women’s dependence on climate-sensitive sectors increases their poverty risk during climate disasters.</li>
                            <li><strong>Health and Safety Vulnerabilities:</strong> Displacement from floods and cyclones leads to inadequate sanitation and healthcare for women, increasing their risk of infections and health issues.</li>
                            <li><strong>Time Poverty:</strong> Climate change-induced resource scarcity increases women’s daily workload, limiting their time for education or economic activities.</li>

                            <li><strong>Caste and Gender:</strong> Dalit and Adivasi women face compounded challenges due to both caste and gender discrimination.</li>
                            <li><strong>Gender and Displacement:</strong> Women face additional risks of sexual violence and limited access to essential services during displacement.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Climate Justice:</strong> Women, especially from marginalized communities, are disproportionately affected by climate change while contributing less to carbon emissions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Inadequate Representation in Decision-Making:</strong> Women are largely excluded from climate policy and decision-making processes at various levels.</li>
