                <h2 class="post-title">The Intersection of Climate Change and Gender Inequality</h2>
                <p>The effects of climate change on <strong>women</strong> and <strong>girls</strong> are exacerbated by additional disparities such as those related to <strong>race</strong>, <strong>disability</strong>, <strong>sexual orientation</strong>, and <strong>location</strong>.</p>

                    <li><strong>Indigenous Women:</strong> Women of Indigenous descent face unique challenges due to cultural and social disparities.</li>
                    <li><strong>LGBTIQ+ Community:</strong> Members of the LGBTIQ+ community are often marginalized and face additional hurdles.</li>
                    <li><strong>Remote Areas:</strong> Residents of remote or violent places experience heightened vulnerabilities during crises.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Advocacy groups highlight that when marginalized groups are invisible in daily life, their demands are frequently disregarded during times of crisis.</p>
                <p>The results of climate action can be greatly enhanced for communities when <strong>gender equality</strong> is taken into account.</p>
