                <ul class="post-text">
                    <li><strong>Climate Vulnerability:</strong> Sub-Saharan Africa is highly vulnerable to climate change, experiencing extreme weather events such as droughts, floods, and erratic rainfall.</li>
                    <li><strong>Women's Workforce:</strong> Women comprise 60-80% of the agricultural workforce but face barriers to land ownership, financial resources, and access to technology.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cycle of Vulnerability:</strong> Climate change exacerbates pre-existing gender inequalities, creating a cycle of vulnerability for women.</li>
                    <li><strong>Global Relevance:</strong> The intersection of climate change and gender inequality threatens global food security, economic development, and human rights.</li>

                <h2 class="post-title">Problem Statement</h2>
                <ul class="post-text">
                    <li><strong>Agricultural Vulnerability:</strong> Women produce 70% of food but own less than 15% of agricultural land, limiting access to credit, resources, and technology.</li>
                    <li><strong>Resource Scarcity:</strong> Women collect 90% of water and fuel in rural areas; climate change increases water scarcity, forcing longer travel distances.</li>
                    <li><strong>Displacement and Disaster Impact:</strong> Climate disasters displace millions, with women facing heightened risks of livelihood loss, gender-based violence, and food insecurity.</li>
                    <li><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Without intervention, climate crises will deepen gender disparities, exacerbate poverty, and undermine progress toward gender equality and sustainable development.</li>

                            <li><strong>Global Initiatives:</strong> UN Women’s Climate Resilience Initiative supports African women in adopting climate-resilient agricultural techniques and improving water management.</li>
                            <li><strong>Local Adaptation Programs:</strong> In Kenya, women's groups lead reforestation efforts and sustainable land-use practices.</li>
